dtos

Tested 
Done

Sprint is a feature indeliverable.

Front -html js
Server - web api
Data - SQL

Break it up with features, what can the user do, they don't care they just want to click

As a user I can: add a sighting, add a power, edit a power, 
Adding a sighting is a feature, oh its in the done, let me check it out


Keeping track of all powers
Many to many
Super powers

Keeping track of sightings
Batman at Starbucks

Checklist on each card.

We will make our own repo and push and pull on git as a group

Each branch should be a feature

Break it up by feature not by you do database you do web api (DO NOT horizontally MVC)

Go into the pom file and update the version

No dtos in individual project

Submission from group is 
Red
Sql file DDL
DTO (as many primary DTOs as controllers)
DAO interface 
Service layer interface
(Service layer can access other service)


Individual will be implemtentation of the group work.

Thymeleaf for front end.
